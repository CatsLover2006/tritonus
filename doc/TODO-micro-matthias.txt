- making spec clear on Controllable.getControl(): parameter should be of type Class.
- which Controls make sense for a DataSource?
- idempotence of DataSource's connect(), disconnect(), start() and stop()
- DataSource supposed to parse file headers? Or Players? Should DataSource deliver "raw data"?
- DataSource: what happens if start() is called on a disconnected DataSource? Suggestion: automatically calls connect().
- why ContentDescriptor as an object for SourceStream? Everywhere else, a String is returned.
