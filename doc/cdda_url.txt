cdda_url.txt

For reading CDs digitally, a special URLHandler is used to provide a
high-level interface.

For programs to work seamlessly, you have to execute the following
statement once:

	[import	org.tritonus.sampled.cdda.CddaURLStreamHandlerFactory;]

	URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory(new CddaURLStreamHandlerFactory());

(It doesn't harm if it's executed more than once. However, the
recommended method is to do this in a static initializer.)


The URL forms in detail:

cdda:
cdda://

returns a list of CDROM drives. For now, a simple list with one line
per drive is provided. The names returned should all start with '/'
(It's not yet clear if it is possible to drop this requirement).  Idea
for the future: return a chunk of XML data that also contain status
information for the drives.

cdda:[drive]

returns the table of content of the drive that is given as a name. The
has to be one of the lines returned by 'cdda:'.  The information is
returned as a chunk of XML data. It contains length, start sector and
other data specific to the tracks.

examples:
cdda:/dev/hdc
cdda:///dev/hdc
returns the table of content for the drive  /dev/hdc


cdda:[drive]#[track]

Returns the digital data of the given track on the given drive.  The
data is in 16 bit linear PCM, stereo.

examples:
cdda:/dev/hdc#4
cdda:///dev/cdrom#4
reads track 4 of the drive /dev/hdc

cdda:#4
cdda://#4
reads track 4 of the default drive

open questions:
- url to read the TOC of the default drive?
Reset possible?
Restrictions on simultaneous reading of multiple tracks?
Byte order? -- set format of returned ais after endianess that the drive reports?
