Compiling the native lametritonus dll
-------------------------------------
1. make sure the header file org_tritonus_lowlevel_lame_Lame.h exists.
   You can create it with 
   javah org.tritonus.lowlevel.lame.Lame .
2. Make sure that the header file BladeMP3EncDLL.h exists. It is included
   in the Lame distribution.
3. Open lametritonus.dsw project workspace in VC++ 6.0. Go to project settings,
   select "All configurations", click on the C/C++ tab and selct as 
   category "Preprocessor". In "Additional include directories" set the
   path of the "include" and "include\win32" directories of your
   JDK1.3 installation.
4. You can set the symbol _BLADEDLL when you want to link statically.
   You need to add lame_enc.dll to the Link section in Project Settings.
   Static loading is not tested.
   Dynamic loading is recommended.
5. Compile (either Release or Debug).

Install the library in e.g.
\JDK1.3\jre\bin\ext (for the JDK 1.3)
\Program Files\JavaSoft\JRE\1.3.0_02\lib\ext (for JRE 1.3.0_02 - also for Java plugin)

When your IE or NS supports Java 2 Version 1.3 or higher directly,
you may need to install it in
\WINNT\java\trustlib (for Internet Explorer)
\Program Files\Netscape\Communicator\java\classes (for Netscape 4.6).
